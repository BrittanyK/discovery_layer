short_string: Something that is totally less than 200 characters
very_long_string: Time to write something that is incredibly poorly written but is for sure longer than 200 characters. It has to use all sorts of different letters and even some numbers. Maybe it can be about chickens. Maybe about dogs. All sorts of different ramblings. Ramblings that can fill books but won't because they are filled with things that aren't even close to interesting. Ramblings that are as painful as watching paint dry or watching grass grow. Ramblings that contain hardly any punctuation.
